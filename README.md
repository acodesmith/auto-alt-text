# Auto Alt Text
WordPress plugin for generating alt text from images using AI image recognition engine.

## Current Supported Services
### AWS Image Rekognition
AWS Key and Secret require full Image Rekognition Permissions. 

## Processing Images
Currently the plugin only supports batch image processing. 
The recognition software can take time to process each image. 
The best method for processing the images is in groups. 
Therefore,**the plugin does not automatically process images!**

## Why?
Image alt text provides a valuable service for people who are visually impaired.
Image alt text can also help with SEO by indexing import keywords.
Most importantly AI image recognition is super cool! 

## Cost
Currently, the only supported service is AWS Image Rekognition. 
AWS charges based on usage. Each image processed will increase the cost.
Please monitor your AWS bill!

## TODOs
* Settings Page needs descriptions for each field
